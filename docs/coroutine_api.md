# STC [coroutine](../include/stc/coroutine.h): Coroutines
![Coroutine](pics/coroutine.jpg)

An implementation of stackless coroutines, which are lightweight threads, providing a blocking
context cheaply using little memory per coroutine.

Coroutines are used to accomplish a non-preempted form of concurrency known as cooperative multitasking and, therefore, do not incur context switching when yielding to another thread. Within a coroutine, **yield** and **await** is accomplished by utilizing Duff's device within a thread's function and an external variable used in within the switch statement. This allows jumping (resuming) from a yield upon another function call. In order to block threads, these yields may be guarded by a conditional so that successive calls to the same function will yield unless the guard conditional is true.

Because these coroutines are stackless, local variables within the coroutine where usage crosses `cco_yield` or `cco_await` must be stored in a struct which is passed as pointer to the coroutine. This has the advantages that they become very lightweight and therefore useful on severely memory constrained systems like small microcontrollers where other solutions are impractical or less desirable.

### Coroutine API

NB! ***cco_yield\*()*** / ***cco_await\*()*** may not be called from within a `switch` statement in a
`cco_routine` scope; Use `if-else-if` constructs instead.

## Implementation and examples

This small implementation of coroutines is inspired by
[Simon Tatham's coroutines](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html) and
[Adam Dunkel's photothreads](https://dunkels.com/adam/pt), but provides big improvements regarding
ergonomics, features, and type-safety. Crucially, it also allows coroutines to self-cleanup when
cancelled (not resumed until they are done).

A coroutine function may have almost any signature, but the implementation adds support for
coroutines which returns an int, indicating CCO_DONE, CCO_AWAIT, or CCO_YIELD. It should also
take a struct pointer as parameter which must contains the member `int cco_state`. The struct should
normally store all *local* variables to be used within the coroutine, along with *input* and *output* data
for the coroutine.

Note that this implementation is not limited to support a certain set of coroutine types,
like generators. It can even operate like stackfull coroutines, i.e. you can efficiently
yield or await from a (deeply) nested coroutine call using cco_task objects described later.

The first example is a generator of Pythagorian triples, and stops when diagonal size > max_c.

[ [Run this code](https://godbolt.org/z/d5zW3f9Gv) ]
```c
#include <stc/coroutine.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdio.h>
// https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2019/03/06/pythagorean-triples/

struct triples {
    int max_c;     // input: max c.
    int a, b, c;   // output
    int cco_state; // required member
};

int triples(struct triples* i) {
    cco_routine(i) {  // the coroutine scope!
        for (i->c = 5;; ++i->c) {
            for (i->a = 1; i->a < i->c; ++i->a) {
                for (i->b = i->a + 1; i->b < i->c; ++i->b) {
                    if ((int64_t)i->a * i->a + 
                        (int64_t)i->b * i->b ==
                        (int64_t)i->c * i->c)
                    {
                        if (i->c > i->max_c)
                            cco_return; // "jump" to cco_final if defined, else exit scope.
                        cco_yield();
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        cco_final:
        puts("done");
    }
    return 0; // CCO_DONE
}

int main(void) {
    struct triples co = {.max_c = 25};
    int n = 0;

    cco_blocking_call(triples(&co)) {
        printf("%d: [%d, %d, %d]\n", ++n, co.a, co.b, co.c);
    }
}
```
The next variant skips the triples which are upscaled version of smaller ones by checking 
the gcd() function. Note that the gcd1_triples struct contains the triples struct so that
both functions have separate call frames:

[ [Run this code](https://godbolt.org/z/a7da9M8P5) ]
```c
int gcd(int a, int b) { // greatest common denominator
    while (b) {
        int t = a % b;
        a = b;
        b = t;
    }
    return a;
}

struct gcd1_triples {
    int max_n, max_c, count; // input: max_n, max_c limit #triples to be generated.
    struct triples tri;    // triples call frame
    int cco_state;
};

int gcd1_triples(struct gcd1_triples* i)
{
    cco_routine(i) {
        cco_reset(&i->tri);
        i->tri.max_c = i->max_c;

        while (triples(&i->tri) != CCO_DONE) {
            // Skip triples with GCD(a,b) > 1
            if (gcd(i->tri.a, i->tri.b) > 1)
                continue;

            // Done when count > max_n
            if (++i->count > i->max_n)
                cco_return;
            else
                cco_yield();
        }
        cco_final:
        cco_stop(&i->tri); // to cleanup state if still active
        triples(&i->tri);  // do cleanup (or no-op if done)
    }
    return 0;
}

int main(void) {
    struct gcd1_triples co = {.max_n = 100, .max_c = 100};
    int n = 0;

    cco_blocking_call(gcd1_triples(&co)) {
        printf("%d: [%d, %d, %d]\n", ++n, co.tri.a, co.tri.b, co.tri.c);
    }
}
```
When using ***cco_blocking_call()***, the coroutine is continuously resumed after each yield suspension.
However, this means that it first calls ***gcd1_triples()***, which immediately jumps to after the `cco_yield`
-statement and calls ***triples()***, which again jumps and resumes after its `cco_yield`-statement. This
is efficient only when yielding or awaiting from the top- or second-level call like here, but naturally not
when couroutine calls are more deeply nested or recursive.

The STC coroutine implementation therefore also contains task-objects (`cco_task`), which are base-coroutine 
objects/enclosures. These can be executed using ***cco_blocking_task()*** instead of ***cco_blocking_call()***.
Inner coroutine calls are done by ***cco_await_task()***, where you may await for a certain return value, normally CCO_YIELD or just CCO_DONE. It uses a stack of pointers of task-enclosures to call the current
inner-level function directly. The task-objects have the added benefit that coroutines can be managed
by a scheduler, which is useful when dealing with large numbers of coroutines (like in many games and
simulations).

Note that these two modes may be mixed, and that for short-lived coroutines (only a few suspends),
it is often beneficial to call the sub-coroutine directly rather than via ***cco_await_task()***
(which pushes the task on top of the runtime stack and yields - then executed on next resume).

The following example uses task-objects with 3-levels deep coroutine calls. It emulates an async generator
by awaiting a few seconds before producing a number, using a timer.

        while (true) {
            cco_await_timer(&co->tm, 1 + rand() % 2); // suspend with CCO_AWAIT
            co->val = rand();
            cco_yield();                              // suspend with CCO_YIELD
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

            cstr_printf(&p->text, "item %d", p->next.val);
            print_time();
            printf("produced %s\n", cstr_str(&p->text));
            cco_yield();
        }
        cco_final:
        cstr_drop(&p->text);

    }
    return 0;
}

        c->produce.cco_func = produce_items;

        for (c->i = 1; c->i <= c->n; ++c->i)
        {
            printf("consume #%d\n", c->i);
            cco_await_task(&c->produce, rt, CCO_YIELD);
            print_time();
            printf("consumed %s\n", cstr_str(&c->produce.text));
        }
        cco_final:

            cco_resume_task(&c->produce, rt);

    }
    return 0;
